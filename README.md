# Deep-Learning-CNN-Model-For-Handwritten-Character-Recognition-in-Image.
Handwritten Character recognition is active working research field in handwritten recognition and pattern recognition domain. 
Step 1:
      Create a Npz File of your dataset.
Step 2:
      Once your Dataset converted into Npz file Load that Npz file into Train_Test.py For training and spliting your data.
      It will create Four diffrent Npz files 2 for Training and 2 For Testing.
Step 3:
      Now load your Training_image, Training_labels, Testing_images, Testing_labels into CNN_model.py
